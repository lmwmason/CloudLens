# CloudLens

CloudLens is an AI-powered Flutter application for exploring atmospheric phenomena.  
By capturing the sky through your smartphone camera, CloudLens identifies cloud types, retrieves real-time weather data, and helps you analyze patterns between clouds and atmospheric conditions.

## Features
- **Cloud Classification**  
  Capture a photo of the sky and let AI detect cloud types (e.g., Cirrus, Cumulus, Cumulonimbus).
- **Weather Data Integration**  
  Get temperature, humidity, and pressure information using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Observation Log**  
  Automatically save each observation with date, location, and weather conditions.
- **Data Visualization**  
  View your past observations on a map and analyze trends via charts.
- **Seasonal/Weather Pattern Analysis**  
  AI analyzes your collection to identify relationships between cloud types and weather.
